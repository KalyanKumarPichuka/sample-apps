# üîç Visual Retrieval ColPali üëÄ

This readme contains the code for a web app including a frontend that can be set up as a user facing interface.

## Why?

To enable _you_ to showcase the power of ColPali and Vespa to your users, and to provide a starting point for your own projects.

> "But I only know Python, how can I create a web app that's not Gradio or Streamlit?" ü§î

No worries! This project uses [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) to create a beautiful web app - and it's all Python! üêç

Also, üëá

<a href="https://imgflip.com/i/98mhch"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/98mhch.jpg" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a>

As a prerequisite, you should run [this notebook](prepare_feed_deploy.ipynb) to prepare the data and deploy the Vespa application.

## Setting up your .env variables

The following variables are required in your `.env` file for the application to be able to connect to the Vespa application and the Gemini API:

You can rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.
The other variables are optional, if you want to use mTLS authentication against the Vespa application.

```bash
VESPA_APP_TOKEN_URL=https://abcde.z.vespa-app.cloud
VESPA_CLOUD_SECRET_TOKEN=vespa_cloud_xxxxxxxx
GEMINI_API_KEY=asdf
```

If you want to deploy the application to Huggingface, you also need to set a `HF_TOKEN` variable, with write permissions.
This is personal, and must be created at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

```bash
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxx
```

## Setting up python environment

This application should work on Python 3.8 and above.

You can install the dependencies with `pip`, but we recommend using `uv`. 
Skip to [Installing dependencies using `uv`](#installing-dependencies-using-uv) if you want to use `uv`.

### Installing dependencies using `pip`

You can install the dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing dependencies using `uv`

We recommend installing the amazing `uv` to manage your python environment:
See also [installation - uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for other installation options.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then, create a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv 
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Sync your virtual environment with the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

## Running the application locally

To run the application locally, you can run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:7860`.

## Deploy to huggingface ü§ó spaces

### Compiling dependencies

Before a deploy, make sure to run this to compile the `uv` lock file to `requirements.txt` if you have made changes to the dependencies:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
```

This will make sure that the dependencies in your `pyproject.toml` are compiled to the `requirements.txt` file, which is used by the huggingface space.

### Deploying to huggingface

To deploy, run

(Replace `vespa-engine/colpali-vespa-visual-retrieval` with your own huggingface user/repo name, does not need to exist beforehand)

```bash
huggingface-cli upload vespa-engine/colpali-vespa-visual-retrieval . . --repo-type=space
```

Note that you need to set `HF_TOKEN` environment variable first.
This is personal, and must be created at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
Make sure the token has `write` access.
Be aware that this will not delete existing files, only modify or add,
see [huggingface-cli](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/upload#upload-from-the-cli) for more
information.

## Development

This section applies if you want to make changes to the web app.

### Adding dependencies

To add dependencies, you can add them to the `pyproject.toml` file and run:

```bash
uv compile
```

and then sync the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Making changes to CSS

To make changes to output.css apply, run

```bash
shad4fast watch # watches all files passed through the tailwind.config.js content section

shad4fast build # minifies the current output.css file to reduce bundle size in production.
```

### Instructions on creating and feeding the full dataset

This section is only relevant if you want to create and feed the full dataset to Vespa.
The notebook referenced in the beginning of this readme should be sufficient if you just want to spin up a scaled down version of the demo.

#### Prepare data and Vespa application

First, install `uv`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then, run:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra feed
```

#### Converting to notebook

If you want to run the `prepare_feed_deploy.py` as a notebook, you can convert it using `jupytext`:

Convert the `prepare_feed_deploy.py` to notebook to:

```bash
jupytext --to notebook prepare_feed_deploy.py
```

And launch a Jupyter instance with:

```bash
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```
