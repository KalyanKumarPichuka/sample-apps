# Vespa sample applications
First-time users should go through the [getting-started](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/getting-started.html) guides first.

The [Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) sample applications are created to run both self-hosted and on Vespa Cloud.
You can easily deploy the sample applications to Vespa Cloud without changing the files -
just follow the same steps as for [vector-search](#vector-search), adding security credentials.

For operational sample applications, see [examples/operations](examples/operations). See
also [PyVespa examples](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html). 



## Getting started - Basic Sample Applications


### Basic album-recommendation
The [album-recommendation](album-recommendation/) is the intro application to Vespa.
Learn how to configure the schema for simple recommendation and search use cases.


### Vector Search
There is a growing interest in AI-powered vector representations of unstructured multimodal data
and searching efficiently over these representations.
[vector-search](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/vector-search)
describes how your organization can unlock the full potential of multimodal AI-powered vector representations
using Vespa Cloud - the industry-leading managed Vector Search Service.


### Simple hybrid semantic search
The [simple semantic search](simple-semantic-search/)
application demonstrates indexed vector search using `HNSW`, 
creating embedding vectors from a transformer language model inside Vespa, and hybrid
text and semantic ranking. This app also demonstrates using native Vespa embedders. 


### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
The [retrieval-augmented-generation](retrieval-augmented-generation) sample application
demonstrates how to build an end-to-end RAG pipeline with API-based and local LLMs.  


### Indexing multiple vectors per field
The [Vespa Multi-Vector Indexing with HNSW](multi-vector-indexing/) app demonstrates how to 
index multiple vectors per document field for semantic search for longer documents.  


### Vespa streaming mode for naturally partitioned data
The [vector-streaming-search](vector-streaming-search) app 
demonstrates how to use vector streaming search. See also [blog post](https://blog.vespa.ai/announcing-vector-streaming-search/). 


### ColBERT token-level embeddings
The [colbert](colbert) application demonstrates how to 
use the Vespa [colbert-embedder](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/embedding.html#colbert-embedder) 
for explainable semantic search with better accuracy than regular
text embedding models. 


### ColBERT token-level embeddings for long documents
The [colbert-long](colbert-long) application demonstrates how to 
use the Vespa [colbert-embedder](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/embedding.html#colbert-embedder) 
for explainable semantic search for longer documents. 


### SPLADE sparse learned weights for ranking
The [splade](splade) application demonstrates how to 
use the Vespa [splade-embedder](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/embedding.html#splade-embedder) for 
semantic search using sparse vector representations. 


### Multilingual semantic search
The [multilingual](multilingual-search) sample application demonstrates multilingual semantic search 
with multilingual text embedding models. 


### Customizing embeddings 
The [custom-embeddings](custom-embeddings) application demonstrates customizing frozen document embeddings for downstream tasks.

as it has system, staging and production test examples.
It uses the [Document API](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-api-guide.html)
both for regular PUT operations but also for UPDATE with _create-if-nonexistent_.


### CORD-19 Search
[cord19.vespa.ai](https://cord19.vespa.ai/) is a full-featured application,
