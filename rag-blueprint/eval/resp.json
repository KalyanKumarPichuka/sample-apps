Overview\nSynapseFlow v0.2 aims to provide a robust platform for deploying and managing ML models with a focus on ease-of-use for developers and MLOps teams. This version introduces scalable inference endpoints and basic model versioning.\n\n## 2. Key Architectural Decisions:\n* **Microservices Architecture:** Core components (API Gateway, Model Serving, Orchestration, Monitoring) are designed as independent microservices.\n    * *Rationale:* Scalability, fault isolation, independent development cycles.\n* **Containerization:** Docker for packaging all services.\n    * *Rationale:* Consistency across environments, ease of deployment.\n* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS on AWS) for managing containerized services.",
                        "\n    * *Rationale:* Auto-scaling, self-healing, rolling updates. (See also: `kubernetes_decision_notes.md`)\n* **API Gateway:** Kong chosen for its plugin architecture and performance.\n* **Model Serving:** Custom Python-based server using FastAPI for low latency, with considerations for Triton Inference Server for future GPU-heavy models.\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching.\n\n## 3. Component Diagram\n(ASCII or Mermaid diagram embedded here)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User API] --> B(API Gateway - Kong);\n    B --> C{Orchestrator - K8s};\n    C --> D[Model Serving Instance 1];\n    C --> E[Model Serving Instance N];\n    D --> F[Model Artifact Store - S3];\n    E --> F;\n    C --> G[Metadata DB - PostgreSQL];\n```\n\n## <MORE_TEXT:HERE> (Detailed API specs, data flows, security considerations)"

                        "# Understanding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - Notes & Links\n\n## Core Concept:\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines pre-trained dense retrieval systems with sequence-to-sequence models (like LLMs) to improve generation quality by grounding responses in external knowledge.\n\n**Key Idea:** Instead of relying solely on the LLM's parametric memory (knowledge learned during training), RAG first retrieves relevant documents/passages from a corpus and then uses these as context for the LLM to generate an answer.\n\n## Foundational Papers (My Saved Copies/Summaries):\n* **\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\" (Lewis et al., 2020):** The original RAG paper. My notes highlight the dual encoder architecture for retriever and the generator conditioning on retrieved docs.\n    * *Implementation Detail Noted:* Using FAISS for efficient dense retrieval.\n* **\"Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering\" ",
                        "(Karpukhin et al., 2020):** Focuses on DPR (Dense Passage Retriever). Notes on training DPR with positive/negative examples.\n\n## My Implementation Thoughts for SynapseFlow (Internal Search/Bot Idea):\n* **Retriever:** Could use a sentence-transformer model fine-tuned on our internal documentation (technical docs, meeting notes, code comments).\n* **Vector DB:** Milvus or Weaviate for storing and querying document embeddings.\n* **Generator:** GPT-3.5/4 via API, or a smaller open-source model if latency/cost is critical.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Crucial to structure the prompt with retrieved context effectively.\n    * Example prompt structure: `\"Based on the following documents: [Doc1 Text], [Doc2 Text], ... Answer the question: [User Question]\"`\n\n## Articles & Blog Posts I Found Useful:\n* [Link to Pinecone blog on RAG]\n* [Link to Hugging Face blog on RAG implementations]\n\n## <MORE_TEXT:HERE> (Code snippets for basic retriever, prompt variations)"

Options considered: Docker Swarm, Nomad, Kubernetes (K8s), custom scripting.\n\n## Arguments FOR Kubernetes:\n1.  **Industry Standard & Ecosystem:** Large community, extensive documentation, wide adoption, readily available talent.\n2.  **Scalability & Resilience:** Proven capabilities for auto-scaling, self-healing, rolling updates.\n3.  **Feature Richness:** Service discovery, load balancing, configuration management, secrets management built-in or easily integrated.\n4.  **Cloud Agnostic (mostly):** While managed K8s services (EKS, GKE, AKS) have vendor specifics, core K8s skills are transferable.\n5.  **YC Network Experience:** Many YC companies successfully use K8s.\n\n## Arguments AGAINST Kubernetes / Concerns:\n1.  **Complexity:** Steep learning curve, operational overhead,",
                        " especially for a small team.\n    * \"Is this overkill for our current scale?\" - [Team Member]\n2.  **Resource Intensive:** Can require more resources (CPU/memory) for the control plane itself.\n3.  **Initial Setup Time:** Longer to get a production-ready cluster configured compared to simpler solutions.\n4.  **Potential for 'Yak Shaving':** Risk of spending too much time on K8s internals rather than product features.\n\n## Decision:\nProceed with managed Kubernetes (AWS EKS) for SynapseFlow v0.2.\n* **Rationale:** Long-term scalability benefits and ecosystem support outweigh initial complexity, especially with a managed service reducing some operational burden. Plan to invest in learning and potentially hire K8s expertise as we grow.\n* **Mitigation for Complexity:** Start with a simple setup, leverage EKS defaults, focus on core deployment needs first.\n\n## <MORE_TEXT:HERE> (Links to articles, team discussion summaries)"

MLflow:**\n* **Pros I Noted:**\n    * Open source, self-hostable (good for cost control initially).\n    * Good integration with Spark and other Apache tools.\n    * Modular: Tracking, Projects, Models, Registry are somewhat distinct.\n    * Python-centric, easy to integrate.\n* **Cons I Noted:",

Might require more custom UI work for advanced dashboards.\n\n**2. Weights & Biases (W&B):**\n* **Pros I Noted:**\n    * Excellent UI/UX, very intuitive for experiment comparison and visualization.\n    * Strong collaboration features (teams, reports).\n    * Seamless integration, very developer-friendly (`wandb.login()`, `wandb.init()`).\n    * Good for hyperparameter sweeps.\n* **Cons I Noted:**\n    * Primarily a SaaS offering;",
                        " self-hosting is possible but more complex/limited.\n    * Can get expensive at scale or with many users/projects.\n    * More of an 'all-in-one' platform, might be overkill if only needing one component.\n* **SynapseFlow Use Case Fit:** Ideal for rapid iteration and visualization, especially if team collaboration on experiments is key. Cost is a factor to monitor.\n\n## Decision (Q3 2024):\nStarted with **MLflow** for initial internal needs due to open-source nature and control. Re-evaluate W&B if visualization and collaborative features become a major bottleneck or if budget allows.\n\n## <MORE_TEXT:HERE> (Evaluation criteria checklist, notes on DVC/CometML)"
